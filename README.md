# Personal Portfolio Website

I'm planning for this website to be a more personalized portfolio wesbite. It will be a place for me to showcase work that I've done, while also serving as a chance to explore web styling and working with HTML CSS. This website will get updated designs in the future, beyond the class, to possibly to look more professional or technically skilled with animations. In any case, my future website would reference this legacy version as a display of how my skills and styling improve over time. Until I get to that point, I will be experimenting with things like JS and animations on my site.
